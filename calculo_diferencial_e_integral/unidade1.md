# Functions

A function is a special relation between two or more quantities.

Intuitively, a function is a way to associate a specific value of x with a one single value of f(x) = y.

## Functions: tables, graphs and equations

Basically, you have three form of representing functions:

- Numerically -> with tables
- Geometrically -> with graphs
- Algebrically -> with mathematical formulas

f(x) = x * 9
